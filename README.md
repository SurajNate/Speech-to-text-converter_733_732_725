Natural Language Processing Micro Project SEM - VII

This project focuses on the development of a Speech-to-Text (STT) converter using Natural Language Processing (NLP) to accurately transcribe spoken language into text. The system employs an automatic speech recognition (ASR) engine combined with an NLP module to enhance accuracy and contextual understanding. By leveraging deep learning models, the ASR component processes real-time audio, converting speech to text efficiently. The NLP module further refines the output by handling linguistic nuances, including homophones, punctuation, and context-based word correction. The system was trained on a large, diverse dataset to ensure robustness across different accents, dialects, and varying noise levels. Evaluation of the model's performance was carried out using key metrics such as word error rate (WER) and response time, showing promising results in live speech transcription. The STT converter developed in this project demonstrates significant potential for applications in real-time transcription, virtual assistants, and voice-controlled systems.
